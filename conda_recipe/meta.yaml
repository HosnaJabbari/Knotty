  summary: "MFE-based RNA secondary structure prediction with pseudoknots."
  description: |
    Knotty is a computational tool for predicting RNA secondary structures, 
    including pseudoknotted configurations, using a Minimum Free Energy (MFE) 
    approach. It allows users to input RNA sequences and receive predicted 
    structural conformations optimized for thermodynamic stability.

    The software is implemented in C++ and requires a C++11-compatible compiler 
    along with CMake (â‰¥3.1) for installation. Knotty is designed to run on Linux 
    and macOS platforms and provides a command-line interface for flexible usage.
