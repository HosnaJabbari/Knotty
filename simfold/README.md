# SimFold

#### Description:
Simfold library used by Knotty. Install before using Knotty.

Description from Mirela Andronescu's original readme:   
SimFold predicts the minimum free energy (MFE) secondary structure of a
given input RNA or DNA sequence. The current implementation include
suboptimal folding calculations, as well as partition functions, base
pair probabilities and gradient computations.

#### Installation: 
First ensure that you have [downloaded the repository](https://github.com/HosnaJabbari/CCJ/archive/master.zip) and extracted the files onto your system.   
Then run the following from a command line in the simfold directory:    
```
autoreconf -i     
./configure    
make  
make install
```

To install the library to a custom path, use
./configure --prefix=\<custom library path>
instead.
